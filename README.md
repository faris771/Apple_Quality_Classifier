# Machine Learning Project - Apple Quality Classification

## Introduction
**ENCS5341** Machine Learning And Data Science project, aims to perform a predictive task on a real-world problem using
machine learning models. We chose a classification task and picked a dataset from
Kaggle. As a baseline model, we evaluated a nearest neighbor baseline using a distance
of our choice and reported the performance of this baseline using both k=1 and k=3. We
then tried to achieve better performance by evaluating two additional models on the task,
namely SVC and ExtraTreeClassifier. We discussed and motivated our model selection
and commented on why the performance has improved. We tuned at least one hyper-
parameter for each model by testing at least 4 different values. Finally, we analyzed the
performance of our best model from examining instances in the test set where our model
exhibits errors
